What is Machine Learning
Machine Learning is said as a subset of artficial intelligence that is mainly concerned with the development of algorithms which allow a computer to learn from the data and past expeierences on their own.

Deep Learning +Machine Learning  =Artficial Learning 
subset of Artficial Learnign is Datascience
What is Data?
Data is Raw facts!
NumericalData or categoricalData or TimeseriesData or TextData

Where we will get the Data?
1. Kaggle
2. Web scraping
3. Third-party Companies
Five of the most popular ML dataset resources:

Google--> Google's Dataset Search
Microsoft---> Microsoft Resarch Open Data
aws --> Amazon Datasets
UCI ---> UCI Machine Learning Repository
DATA.Gov --> Government Datasets

Machine Learning
Supervised: Input and Output will be provided by user using label data Task Driven (Predict next value)
Unsupervised: We dont give label data (data Driven (identify Clusters)
Reinforcement: Learn from mistakes

MachineLearning Steps
Step-1 Data gathering
Gathering Data from various third-party companies, websites, institutions etc
observations 
interviews and Focus Groups
Transactional Tracking
Social Media Monitoring
Online Tracking
Surveys
Forms

step: 2 Data Preprocession
Data Preprocessing is the process of transforming raw data into an understandable format.
Major Tasks in dta preprocessing:
Data cleaning
Data Integration
Data Reduction
Data Transformation

Data preproccing uses Tools and Libraries
Libraries
1. pandas --stats
2. Nummpy
Tools
ETL Tools
Excel ---or powerBI or Tableau

Step-3 Data Visualization
Data visulaization is the graphical representaion of information and data. By using visual elements like charts, graphsm and maps
libraries
1. Matplotlib
2. Seaborn
3. plotly
Tools:
1. PowerBI
2. Tableau

Step 4: Data Modeling
1. Selecting The Algorithm
2. Training the model
3. Testing the model
Uses sklearn

DataModiling---->TestData-->ModeTesting
DataModiling----->ModelTraing&building---> Model Testing


Step 5: Deployment
Deployment of an ML-model simply means the integration of the model into an existing production environment which can take in an inout and return an output that can be used in making practical business decisions.
For deployment
1. Django or Flask
2. Sql
3. Github
4. AWS or Azure or GCP
5. Heroku
