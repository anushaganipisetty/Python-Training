'''
There is a function in the form of int(string, base) that is useful to cconvert a string into a decimal integer. 'String' represents the string format of the number. It should contain integer number in string format. 'Base' represents the base of the number system to be used for the string.For example, base 2 indiacates binary number and base 16 indicates hexadecimal number
'''
str1 = "1c2"  # string str contains a hexa decimal number
N = int(str1, 16)  # base is 16, convert str into int
print(N)  # this will display 450
''' we can also use functions bin() for converting a number into binary number system, The function oct() will convert
a number into octal number system and the function hex() will convert a number into hexadecimal number system 
'''
a1 = 10
b1 = bin(a1)
print(b1)  # will display 0b1010

b1 = oct(a1)
print(b1)  # output will be 0o12

b1 = hex(a1)
print(b1)  # output will be 0Xa1

'''
bool Datatype

The bool datatype in python represents boolean values, There are only two boolean values  True or false that can be represented by this datatype. Python internally represents True as 1 and False as 0. A blank string like " " is also represented as false)
'''
a2 = 10
b2 = 20
if (a2 < b2):
    print("Hello")  # displays Hello
a2 = 10>5  # here 'a' is treated as bool type variable
print(a2)  # displays true

a2 = 5>10
print(a2)  # displays False

print(True+True)  # will display 2  # true is 1 and false is 0

print(True-False)  # will display 1

'''
Sequences in python

Generally , a Sequences represents a group of elements or items. For example, a group of integer numbers will form a sequence. There are six types of sequences in pyhton:
> Str
> Bytes
> Bytearray
> list
> tuple
> range

'''

# Str Datatype
''' str represents string datatype, strings are enclosed by " " double quotes or ' ' single quotes.
'''
str = "Welcome"  # here str is name of string type variable
str = ' Welcome'  # here str is name of string type variable

'''
we can also write strings inside """ (triple double quotes ) or 
 (triple single quotes ) to span a group of lines including spaces. 
'''

str1 = """ This is abook on python which discuss all the topics of core python in a very lucid manner. """
str2 = ''' This is a book on python which discuss all the topics of core python in a very lucid manner.'''
str3 = " " " This is 'core python' book." " "
print(str3)  # will display : This is 'core python' book.
str4 = ''' This is " core python " book.'''
print(str4)  # will display: this is " core python" book.

''' 
The slice operator represents square brackets [ and ] to retrieve pieces of a string. For example, the characters in a string are counted from - onwords. Hence, str[0] indicates the 0th character or beginning character in the evening.'''
str5 = 'Welcome to core python'  # this is the original string
print(str5)  # output will be Welcome to core python
print(str5[0])  # displays 0th character from s value will be W
print(str5[1])  # displays the first position character from s value will be e
print(str5[2])  # displays the 2nd character from s value will be l
print(str5[3:7])  # displays the 3rd to 6th characters s value will be come
print(str5[11:])  # displays the 11th character onwards till end s value will be core python
print(str5[-1])  # displays first character from the end n

'''

the repetation operator is denoted by '*' symbol and useful to repeat the string for several times.
 For example s*n repeats the string for n times.
 '''
print(str5*2)
#  Welcome to core pythonWelcome to core python
'''
bytes datatype
a byte number is any positive integers from 0 to 255. 
'''
elements=[10,20,0,40,15] # this is a list of bytes numbers
x = bytes(elements) # convert the list into bytes array
print(x[0]) # display 0th element. i.e 10
for i in x:
  print(i)

# program to understand bytes type array
# create a list of byte numbers
elements = [10,20,0,40,15]
# convert the list into bytes type array
x = bytes(elements)
print(x)
# retrieve elements from x using for loop and display
for i in x: print(i)

'''
bytearray datatype
'''
elements = [10,20,0,40,15] # this is a list of byte numbers
X1 = bytearray(elements)  # convert the list into bytearray type array
print(X[10])  # diplay 0th element , i.e 10
#modify the first two elements of x
X1[0] = 88
X1[1] = 99
X1 = bytearray(elements)
# retrieve elements from x using for loop and display
for i in X1 : print(i)
